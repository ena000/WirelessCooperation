WirelessCooperation
===================

Energy efficiency is gaining importance in wireless communication
networks which have nodes with limited energy supply
and signal processing capabilities.
We present a numerical study of cooperative communication scenarios
based on simple local rules. This is in contrast to most of the
approaches in the literature which enforce cooperation by using
complex algorithms and require strategic complexity of the network
nodes. The approach is motivated by recent results in evolutionary
biology which suggest that, if certain mechanism is at work,
cooperation can be favored by natural
selection, i.e. even selfish actions
of the individual nodes can lead to emergence of cooperative
behavior in the network. The results of the simulations in the
context of wireless communication networks verify these
observations and indicate that uncomplicated local rules, followed
by simple fitness evaluation, can generate network behavior which
yields global energy efficiency.
